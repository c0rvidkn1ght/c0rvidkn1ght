-People who make SA jokes like "This person is (m0l3sting/or touching) me!! /jk" or ANYTHING LIKE THAT. LIKE UHM... SA IS ACTUALLY A VERY SERIOUS TOPIC AND THING. ITS LIKE YOU'RE 
TRYING TO MAKE IT LESS SERIOUS. LIKE.... PEOPLE, IN REAL LIFE, ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT. DON'T DOWNPLAY IT.

-basic dni

-People who support the term infantilize

-IF YOU'RE LIKE 12 OR SOMETHING. You really shouldn't be on the internet. 
  -PEOPLE WHO ARE 12 AND YOUNGER. Internet is really dangerous
  -People who are BODILY 12 and below

-People who ship people in real life even if they're NOT in a relationship... THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE WITH ACTUAL FEELINGS.

-People who support cults and are in cults

-People who force their ships on people. Like, people can like their own ships as long as it's not problematic.

-People who use the word "Y4nd3r3" lightly (I censored it). And any other word like that. ITS OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES

-People who think bounderies like "DNTUF" or "DNIUF" OR ANYTHING SIMILAR is BAD and/or RIDICULOUS . Like, anyone can have bounderies! You have one job to respect them.

-People who think that a certain fandom is bad beause of the PEOPLE IN IT. If the fandom is weird but the source of fandom isn't, it's the fandom.
NOT THE GAME OR SHOW OR BOOK, OR ETC. "Omg, I hate the (FANDOM NAME) so bad. It has weird ships and stuff." AND THE FANDOM WOULD BE A KIDS GAME. In every fandom there is
ALWAYS gonna be strange people... AND I HATE THAT FACT!!!! I wish every fandom is NORMAL!!!
FANDOM IS NOT THE SAME AS THE SOURCE! (Yes, I'm talking about Dandy's World and any case similar)
